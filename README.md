scheb/two-factor-bundle
=======================

**⚠️ Version 2.x is no longer maintained. Please upgrade your project to a recent version.**

This Symfony bundle provides two-factor authentication for your website. Currently it is shipped with two authentication methods:

  - Google Authenticator (via sonata-project/google-authenticator)
  - Authentication code sent via email

In addition to this it provides an interface for implementing your own custom two-factor authentication methods.

**Compatibility:** Use bundle version 1.x for Symfony < 2.6.

Security Considerations for scheb/two-factor-bundle
-----------------------

**⚠️ Version 2.x is no longer maintained. Please upgrade your project to a recent version.**

In this version of the bundle it was possible to bypass two-factor authentication when the remember-me option is
available on the login form. ([#253](https://github.com/scheb/two-factor-bundle/issues/253))

After the initial login happened, the user is already fully authenticated to the Symfony security layer. The bundle
then prevents access to secured and non-secured content by intercepting any request and showing the two-factor
authentication form instead.

If you execute code based on the authentication status, make sure to take the two-factor status into account. This can
be done by checking access with `isGranted` (security voter has to be registered, see
[configuration](Resources/doc/configuration.md)).

**Warning**: Just doing a `getUser` on `security.token_storage` (or the old `security.context`) is not secure. You will
get a user object even when two-factor authentication is not complete yet.
